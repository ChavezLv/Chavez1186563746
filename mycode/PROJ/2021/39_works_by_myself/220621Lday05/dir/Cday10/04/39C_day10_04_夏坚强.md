## 题目描述

- (a).  假设数组是先单调递增到一个峰值，然后单调递减的。设计并实现算法找到峰值元素的下标。
- (b). 下面是一篇文章的段落的若干个句子。每个句子都存在一个编号。从键盘中输入一个单词，判断这个单词有没有在段落中出现过，如果出现过，输出其第一次出现时所在句子的编号。

```
  1 "They sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old man and he was noteangry. "
  2 "Others, of the older fishermen, looked at him and were sad. "
  3 "But they did not show it and they spoke politely about the current and the depths they had drifted their lines at and the steady good weather and of what they had seen." 
  4 "The successful fishermen of that day were already in and had butchered their marlin out and carried them laid full length across two planks, with two men staggering at the end of each plank, to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to carry them to the market in Havana. "
  5 "Those who had caught sharks had taken them to the shark factory on the other side of the cove where they were hoisted on a block and tackle, their livers removed, their fins cut off and their hides skinned out and their flesh cut into strips for salting. "

## 答案

- (a)

  ```
  #define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS
  #include<stdio.h>
  #include<string.h>
  #include<stdlib.h>
  #include<time.h>
  #define N 20
  int findtuofeng(int *arr, unsigned int length)
  {
  	int low=0, mid, high=length-1;
  	while (low <= high)
  	{
  		mid = (low + high) / 2;
  		if (arr[mid] > arr[mid - 1] && arr[mid] > arr[mid + 1])
  		{
  			return mid;
  		}
  		else if (arr[mid] > arr[mid - 1] && arr[mid] < arr[mid + 1])
  		{
  			low = mid + 1;
  		}
  		else if (arr[mid] < arr[mid - 1] && arr[mid] > arr[mid + 1])
  		{
  			high = mid-1;
  		}
  	}
  }
  void main()
  {
  	int arr[N];
  	for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
  	{
  		arr[i] = 14*i-i*i;
  	}
  	int addr=findtuofeng(arr, N);
  	printf("%d ", addr);
  	
  }
  ```

  

- (b)

```c
#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS
#include<stdio.h>
#include<string.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<time.h>
#define N 50
void main()
{
	char arr[5][300] = { "They sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old man and he was noteangry.",
		"Others, of the older fishermen, looked at him and were sad.",
		"But they did not show it and they spoke politely about the current and the depths they had drifted their lines at and the steady good weather and of what they had seen." ,
   "The successful fishermen of that day were already in and had butchered their marlin out and carried them laid full length across two planks, with two men staggering at the end of each plank, to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to carry them to the market in Havana. ",
   "Those who had caught sharks had taken them to the shark factory on the other side of the cove where they were hoisted on a block and tackle, their livers removed, their fins cut off and their hides skinned out and their flesh cut into strips for salting. "
	};
	char buffer[20];
	scanf("%s", buffer);
	int i, j, k;
	for ( i = 0; i < 5; i++)
	{
		for (j = 0, k = 0; arr[i][j] != '\0' && k < strlen(buffer); j++)
		{
			if (arr[i][j] == buffer[k])
			{
				k++;
			}
			else
			{
				j = j - k + 1;
				k = 0;
			}
		}
		if (k == strlen(buffer))
		{
			break;
		}
	}
	printf("该单词第一次出现在%d行", i+1);
}


```

## 提示

- (a)采用二分查找
- (b)使用一个数组存储文章，先将所有的标点符号转为空格，然后将小写字母转换成大写字母，随后采用哈希查找
