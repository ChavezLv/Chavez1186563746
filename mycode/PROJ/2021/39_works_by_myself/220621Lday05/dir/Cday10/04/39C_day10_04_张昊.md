# 王道训练营C++方向--测试025

## 题目描述

- (a).  假设数组是先单调递增到一个峰值，然后单调递减的。设计并实现算法找到峰值元素的下标。
- (b). 下面是一篇文章的段落的若干个句子。每个句子都存在一个编号。从键盘中输入一个单词，判断这个单词有没有在段落中出现过，如果出现过，输出其第一次出现时所在句子的编号。

```
  1 "They sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old man and he was noteangry. "
  2 "Others, of the older fishermen, looked at him and were sad. "
  3 "But they did not show it and they spoke politely about the current and the depths they had drifted their lines at and the steady good weather and of what they had seen." 
  4 "The successful fishermen of that day were already in and had butchered their marlin out and carried them laid full length across two planks, with two men staggering at the end of each plank, to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to carry them to the market in Havana. "
  5 "Those who had caught sharks had taken them to the shark factory on the other side of the cove where they were hoisted on a block and tackle, their livers removed, their fins cut off and their hides skinned out and their flesh cut into strips for salting. "

  INPUT: they
  OUTPUT: 1

## 答案

- (a)

```c
#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<string.h>

int FindTop(int* arr, int n) {
	int left = 0;
	int right = n - 1;
	while (left <= right) {
		int middle = left + (right - left) / 2;
		if (arr[middle] > arr[middle - 1] && arr[middle] < arr[middle + 1]) {
			left = middle; //middle处在递增阶段，峰值在middle右侧
		}
		else if (arr[middle] > arr[middle + 1] && arr[middle] < arr[middle - 1]) {
			right = middle; //middle处在递增减阶段，峰值在middle左侧
		}
		else {
			return middle; //峰值元素下标
			break;
		}
	}
}

int main() {
	int arr[12] = { 1,2,3,12,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4 };
	int ans= FindTop(arr, 12);
	printf("%d\n", ans);
	return 0;
}
```

(b)

```c
#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<string.h>
#define MAXKEY 1000

void change(char ch[][500]) { //转换，标点符号转为空格，大写字母转为小写字母
	for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
		for (int j = 0; j < 500; j++) {
			if (ch[i][j] >= 'A' && ch[i][j] <= 'Z') {
				ch[i][j] += 32;
			}
			else if (ch[i][j] >= 'a' && ch[i][j] <= 'z') {
				continue;
			}
			else {
				ch[i][j] = ' ';
			}
		}
	}
}

char* mystrtok(char* str, const char* delim, char** saveptr) { //切割单词
	if (str != NULL){
		*saveptr = str;
	}
	while (**saveptr == *delim){
		++* saveptr;
	}
	if (**saveptr == 0){
		return NULL;
	}
	char* res = *saveptr;
	while (*saveptr != '\0' && **saveptr != *delim){
		++* saveptr;
	}
	if (**saveptr == *delim){
		**saveptr = 0;
		++* saveptr;
	}
	return res;
}

int hash(char* key) {
	int h = 0, g;
	while (*key)
	{
		h = (h << 4) + *key++;
		g = h & 0xf0000000;
		if (g)
			h ^= g >> 24;
		h &= ~g;
	}
	return h % MAXKEY;
}

int main() {
	char target[20] = "they"; //待查询单词
	int hashTable[MAXKEY] = { 0 };
	char ch[5][500] = {
		"They sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old man and he was noteangry. ",
		"Others, of the older fishermen, looked at him and were sad. ",
		"But they did not show it and they spoke politely about the current and the depths they had drifted their lines at and the steady good weather and of what they had seen.",
		"The successful fishermen of that day were already in and had butchered their marlin out and carried them laid full length across two planks, with two men staggering at the end of each plank, to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to carry them to the market in Havana. ",
		"Those who had caught sharks had taken them to the shark factory on the other side of the cove where they were hoisted on a block and tackle, their livers removed, their fins cut off and their hides skinned out and their flesh cut into strips for salting. "
	};
	change(ch);
	//信息插入哈希表中
	for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
		char* ptr = ch[i];//当前字符
		char* res = mystrtok(NULL, " ", &ptr); //单词
		int index = hash(res); //单词在哈希表中的下标
		//读入该编号句子第一个单词的信息
		if (hashTable[index] == 0) {
			hashTable[index] = i + 1; //单词对应的句子编号
		}
		//读入该编号句子后续单词的信息
		while ((res = mystrtok(NULL, " ", &ptr)) != NULL) {
			if (hashTable[hash(res)] == 0) {
				hashTable[hash(res)] = i + 1;
			}
		}
	}

	//哈希查找
	if (hashTable[hash(target)]) { //单词存在
		printf("%d\n", hashTable[hash(target)]);
	}
	return 0;
}
```

## 提示

- (a)采用二分查找
- (b)使用一个数组存储文章，先将所有的标点符号转为空格，然后将小写字母转换成大写字母，随后采用哈希查找
